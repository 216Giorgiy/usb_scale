A C# class to interface with a USB scale extended from the blog post http://nicholas.piasecki.name/blog/2008/11/reading-a-stamps-com-usb-scale-from-c-sharp/

This class uses Mike O’Brien’s USB HID library, which can be found at: http://github.com/mikeobrien/HidLibrary Current Binaries: http://github.com/mikeobrien/HidLibrary/downloads

See Example.cs on how to use the library.

Tested with the Mettler Toledo PS60 Scale (may work with other Mettler Toledo scales automaticly)
Should also support the Stamps.com USB Scale

Other scale support should be possible by adding their vendor/product id to the Connect() method in the Scale.cs file.
